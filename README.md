# Google_Stock_Price_Predictor
In this project we tried to predict the stock price of google (january 2017). In financial engineering there a term called Brownian motion which tells,future stock price are independent from past, thats why we have tried to predict stock prices by following upward and downward trend of google stock (2012 to 2016)
